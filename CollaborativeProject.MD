## Collaborative Project: Zotero 

In this collaborative project, my team and I were tasked with researching a scholarly digital tool that performed certain tasks such as mapping, geospatial analysis, text analysis, and digital interpretation. We decided to research and analyze the digital tool Zotero. Zotero is a cataloguing and organizational tool that can save research, organize it, and export it in a number of useful ways, both offline and in the cloud. We organized our research in a Google slides presentation, and included our own experiences with the tool. In our research, we found that Zotero can assist in gathering and organizing large amounts of research for academics and scholars alike.
