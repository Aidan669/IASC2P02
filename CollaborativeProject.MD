## The Project: Zotero 

In this collaborative project, my team and I researched and analyzed the digital tool Zotero. Zotero is a cataloguing 
and organizational tool that can save research, organize it, and export it in a number of useful ways, both offline and in the cloud. 
Zotero functions as web browser plugin that can sense data and documents on an active web page. By clicking the Zotero button at the top of the browser, it saves automatically saves the data or documents onto your computer. Once saved, documents can be organized in any way. Finding documents is also quite easy, thanks to Zoteroâ€™s document preview window, and search feature.
