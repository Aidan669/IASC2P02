# Collaborative Project: Zotero

  In this collaborative project, my team and I were tasked with researching a scholarly digital tool that performed certain tasks such as mapping, geospatial analysis, text analysis, and digital interpretation. We decided to research and analyze the digital tool Zotero. Zotero is a cataloguing and organizational tool that can save research, organize it, and export it in a number of useful ways, both offline and in the cloud. We organized our research in a Google slides presentation, and included our own experiences with the tool. In our research, we found that Zotero can assist in gathering and organizing large amounts of research for academics and scholars alike.

## Collaboration Statement 

When engaging in collaborative scholarship, I like to start by having a conversation with my team. I like to discuss the topic, or potential topics, make notes, and get to understand where my research partners are coming from, and how they would like to approach the research. This can help make sure the team is on the same page. To facilitate our discussions, my group and I created an online group message, as well as scheduled in person meetings in order to discuss how we wanted to approach the research. My team also used group message for real time instant communication when we could not meet in person. We established the areas of research each person would focus on, and divided our project accordingly. For the presentation of our research, we used Google Slides. This tool is efficient and effective because it it cloud based, allowing us to build the presentation online in real time, while automatically saving our work. It also allowed us to view and present our work anywhere.

This type collaboration can enrich my academic thinking because it allows me to gain different views and perspectives of the same topic, idea or research. This is extremely important because it cannot only help to eliminate research bias, but it can potentially take research to a higher level. For example, if each every research collaborator has a certain specialization, they apply their area of knowledge to a specific part of the research, and ultimately provide more in depth conclusions. I believe that Collaboration advances my research by giving me the chance to work with other academics that share the same or similar interests in the digital humanities. I hope to use collaboration as a tool to gain a well-rounded knowledge of the digital humanities, in and around the areas I would like to research.
