## Welcome to my site 

My name is Aidan Crawley. I am originally from Toronto, but began studying at Brock in 2015. I am in my second year of the Interactive Arts and Sciences program at Brock University, and I intend to complete this undergraduate program with honours. My specific interests in the digital humanities involves unterface design, audio-visual design, and text analysis.  I like to explore website design, sound design and production, and how digital humanities theories apply to these areas. I also enjoy exploring the different software used for design and production in audio-visual projects. A research program I would like to undertake in the field would be to explore how 3D audio and video can be better integrated for a more interactive experience, but also how we can use specific digital tools to bring us away from our screens, while keeping us online. I have applied myself in each of these areas by creating projects, such as coding a website, designing a concept UI, and designing soundscapes for several scenarios. I would like to take what I learn in IASC and apply it to the digital humanities, by either creating digital tools, or doing research to improve the way we can interact through our digital tools.
