# Welcome to my site

My name is Aidan Crawley. I am originally from Toronto, but began studying at Brock in 2015. I am in my second year of the Interactive Arts and Sciences program at Brock University, and I intend to complete this undergraduate program with honours. My specific interests in the digital humanities involves interface design, audio-visual design, and text analysis.  I like to explore website design, sound design and production, and how digital humanities theories apply to these areas. I also enjoy exploring the different software used for design and production in audio-visual projects. A an area of research I would like to undertake in the field would be to explore how 3D audio and video can be better integrated for a more interactive experience. I would also like to research how we can use specific digital tools to bring us away from our screens, but at the same time keep us online. I have applied myself in each of these areas by creating projects, such as bulding/coding websites, designing a concept UI, and designing soundscapes for several scenarios. I would like to take what I learn in the IASC program and apply it to specific job or field situated in digital humanities, by either creating digital tools, or doing research to improve the way we can interact through our digital tools.

## Featured Project
[Discussing Algorithmic Criticisms by Stephen Ramsay](blog.md)

**Abstract:**
This project consists of the analysis of section one of Stephen Ramsay’s “Reading Machines”, as well as further research of text analysis tools, and how they are being used in the context of the digital humanities. I argue that digital text analysis, and all other digital tools being used in the humanities is a positive thing. While supporting Ramsay’s work, I also add my own conversation regarding quantity versus quality,a theme in Reading Machines, and how the combination science and humanities is a positive step forward for both empirical and hermeneutical thinkers. In this blog style research, I started with analysis Ramsay’s work in close detail, making sure I clearly understood Ramsay’s discourse. I decided to write a piece supporting Ramsay’s work, as well as the topics he discusses. This involved some summary and reflection on his research into how digital humanities practices are perceived by traditional humanities scholars. Next, I compare Ramsay’s ideas to the ideas of other digital humanities scholars such as Bethany Nowviskie, and her work “neatline & visualization as interpretation”, as well as Jennifer London’s Re-imagining the Cambridge School in the Age of Digital Humanities. Each provides support for my argument of support for digital text analysis. In my concluding remarks, I found that I was not only in agreement with Ramsay, but I could fully understand what he wanted to see in the digital humanities. I feel that my own conclusions were very similar to Ramsay’s becasue I am in support of the combination of theory and application, and science and humanities. 

**Process and reflection:**
This research began by exploring the topic that was most interesting. I decided to write my academic blog in response to Stephen Ramsay’s work because I felt it was a specific topic placed in a much larger conversation. I read through Ramsay’s work a number of times, making notes at some points, and frequently had to refer back to the text during the composition of this blog. Initially, I wrote this piece in a style that reflected more of a summary than a response. This original version had the same themes as the final copy, but with the help of instructor feedback, I realized that my argument could be far better developed, and that I required more support for my argument. I decided to do more research, looking for articles that could provide support for my argument, but could also give new perspectives on the topic. I decided to include the work of Jennifer London, who explored how the digital humanities have helped political scientists of all kinds to collaborate. 

I think that the research I have undertaken in writing this piece has expanded my knowledge of the digital humanities, and I feel that I see them in a whole new way. Ramsay’s piece carefully breaks down the digital humanities in a number of ways. To me, the digital humanities take traditional humanities subjects, and explores them from a slightly more scientific angle. As well, they combine qualitative and quantitative information to become one process of research and analysis. Finally, the digital humanities allow adacemics and scholars who have different ways of thinking and approach more opportunities to work together to create new and exciting discourses.
